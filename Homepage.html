    <h3>Background Information</h3>
    <ul>
      Respiration:
        Respiration is the process of organisms combining oxygen and glucose molecules to create energy and generate CO2 in the mitochondria.
      Fungal respiration creates byproducts, both useful and harmful to organisms,
      such as lactic acid or alcohol during the process called fermentation which generates molecules that the bacterial mitochondria such as the one of yeast can turn into ATP.
      Carbohydrates are molecules composed of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen used by organisms to generate energy. 
    <br><br><br>
    ATP:
        ATP is adenosine triphosphate, which is the source of energy for use and storage at the cellular level.
      ATP is used in many reactions in an organism. ATP releases energy as a phosphate(PO43-) molecule is detached, turning it into ADP(adenosine diphosphate).
      ADP molecules can then be turned into ATP molecules through respiration and then the cycle can repeat.
    <br><br><br>
    Carbohydrate:
        Carbohydrates can be split into four types, monosaccharides, disaccharides, oligosaccharides, and polysaccharides. Polysaccharides, oligosaccharides, and monosaccharides have to be broken down into monosaccharides.
      Fructose and galactose have to be converted into glucose before being turned into ATP(Adenosine Triphosphate), energy-carrying molecules.
    <br><br><br>
    Yeast:
        Yeast has about 500 different species.
      Yeast transforms carbohydrates into alcohol and CO2 to create ATP, energy-carrying molecules.
      However, yeast is sometimes used for scientific use. Yeast is widely used in biology experiments because it is easy to grow, and manipulate and can yield results very quickly. 
      This makes yeast a very good choice for many biological experiments as yeast gives results quickly, is very reliable, and is not bound by animal ethics guidelines as yeast is a type of fungi that allows wing experiments that include deprivation of nutrients.
