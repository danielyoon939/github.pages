    <ul><li>  Yeast -  Yeast has about 500 different species. Yeast transforms carbohydrates into alcohol and CO2 to create ATP, energy-carrying molecules.
        However, yeast is sometimes used for scientific use. Yeast is widely used in biology experiments because it is easy to grow, and manipulate and can yield results very quickly.
        This makes yeast a very good choice for many biological experiments as yeast gives results quickly, is very reliable, 
        and is not bound by animal ethics guidelines as yeast is a type of fungi that allows wing experiments that include deprivation of nutrients.
